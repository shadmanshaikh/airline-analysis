## Problem Statement

Airlines worldwide strive to maintain on-time performance while minimizing cancellations and delays. Disruptions can lead to negative customer experiences and operational inefficiencies. This project analyzes flight data from major airlines to uncover trends in cancellations, delays, and on-time performance, offering actionable insights to enhance airline efficiency.

## Objectives

- **Track Weekly Performance:** Monitor weekly cancellations, delays, and on-time flights across 10 major airlines.
- **Analyze Yearly Trends:** Examine yearly average delays for over 5,000 flights to identify performance patterns.
- **Provide Actionable Insights:** Deliver findings to help reduce delays and cancellations, improving overall airline performance.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises flight information from 10 major airlines over multiple months and years (2009â€“2010). Key fields include:

- **Origin Airport:** Departure airport.
- **Airline Name:** Operating airline.
- **Departure Hour:** Flight departure time.
- **Day of Week:** Day of flight.
- **Year:** Flight year (2009 or 2010).
- **Month:** Flight month.
- **On-Time Flights:** Number of on-time flights.
- **Total Flights:** Total flights operated.
- **Flights Delayed:** Number of delayed flights.
- **Flights Cancelled:** Number of cancelled flights.
- **Average Delay:** Average delay in minutes for delayed flights.

## Analysis

1. **Weekly Flight Analysis:** Assessed weekly performance, focusing on cancellations, delays, and on-time flights across all 10 airlines.
2. **Yearly Flight Analysis:** Compared 2009 and 2010 performance, examining average delay times, total delays, and cancellations per airline.
3. **Monthly Analysis:** Analyzed performance across months to identify seasonal patterns influencing delays or cancellations.
4. **Airline-Wise Breakdown:** Identified airlines with the highest number of delays and cancellations, highlighting areas for improvement.

## Visualization and Results

An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize key findings, including:

- **Weekly Flight Performance:** Bar charts displaying on-time, delayed, and cancelled flights for each day of the week.
- **Performance Distribution:** Pie charts summarizing the distribution of on-time, delayed, and cancelled flights.
- **Airline Performance Comparison:** Year-over-year bar charts comparing total flights and delays per airline for 2009 and 2010.

### Key Insights

- **Mid-Week Delays:** Wednesdays experienced the highest delays, correlating with increased flight volumes.
- **Yearly Improvements:** 2010 saw a reduction in cancellations compared to 2009, though delays remained significant, especially for larger airlines like Delta and American Airlines.
- **Airline Performance:** American Airlines had the highest number of delays, while smaller airlines like ExpressJet exhibited better on-time performance.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into airline performance, highlighting areas for operational improvements to enhance efficiency and customer satisfaction. The interactive dashboard serves as a tool for stakeholders to monitor and address performance issues effectively.
